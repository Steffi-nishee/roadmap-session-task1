Objects and its internal representation in javascript

Objects are important data types in javascript. Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.).
Objects can hold many values in form of Key.
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

EXAMPLE
      KEY                    VALUE
Var Car ={
 
wheels    :            4,
Colour    :            "red",
milege    :            15,
brand     :            "BMW"
}

After creating myCar object, the value inside the object can be accessed using keys.
